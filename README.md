Agama
Agama is an auth-server component that offers an alternative way to build authentication flows in Janssen server. Originally, person authentication flows are defined in the server by means of jython scripts that adhere to a predefined API. With Agama, flows are coded in a DSL (domain specific language) designed for the sole purpose of writing web flows.
